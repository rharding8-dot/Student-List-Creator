---Summary---
This project displays a menu system in the console, takes input from the user to create a student object,
including information about their date of birth, name, gpa, and credits taken. It displays using uniquely created
data types such as Name and Date, to ultimately create the Student object. When the user is done creating students
they can then print them out in the console via the menu prompt. Error handling is also included.
